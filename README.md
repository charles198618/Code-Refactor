# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Description 

This is a code refactor that I'm creating. Basically, it is an important process that a junior developper or a fron-end developper does frequently at work. Thus the new developper will be given a pre-written code. And his or her job is to fix it. However, the code will not be modified. But, it will look much better.

## OBJECTIVES

The motivation that pushed me to realize this project is because I wanted to fix a code that the other developper did. Therefore as a new front-end or junior developper, I wanted to improve my skills, by making the code look beautiful. As a result, my boss will be happy and the customer as well.

## Languages used

In order to get to this result, I have use HTML, and CSS. First of all, we can think about HTML as a body. it stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Basically, it is a language that we can use to create web pages. Thus every single on internet is written using HTML. Moreover, it includes elements on the pages, images on the pages, the orders of the appearance of elements and so on. Secondly, we have CSS that stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is used to make our website beautiful. It's used to define the cell padding of table cells, the style, the thickness, and color of a table's border, and the padding around images or other objects. 

## Challenges met

There was many challenges during the realization of this project. One of the challenge was how to use CSS to make the application or the web site look beautiful.
